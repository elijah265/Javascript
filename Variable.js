/*  A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
   To create a variable in JavaScript, use the var, let and const keywords.
   var is an outdated method of declearing a variable.

let massage = 'Hello';//declearing and assigning
let userName // declearing
userName = "Elijah"; // asigning the string to userName
console.log(massage); // Hello
console.log(userName); // Elijah
 // we can declear multiple Variables

 let userFirstName = "Elijah"; // Elijah
     userLasttName = "Peter"; // Peter
     age = 26; // 26
     country = 'Nigeria'; // Nigeria
     city = "Abuja"; // Abuja

     console.log(userFirstName);
     console.log(userLasttName);
     console.log(age);
     console.log(country);
     console.log(city);

// We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.
let hello = "hello, World!"
let msg;
msg = hello; // hello, World!
console.log(msg);

// A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:
/*
let Name  = 'Eliajh';
let Name = 'Peter'; // Syntaxerror: 'massage' has been  already been declared
*/



// costant:o declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:
//Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:
const myName = "Elijah";
myBirthday = "14.02.1997";
